# Mobile Information Systems

## Big issues

- Limited power supply
- Limited storage
- Wireless communication channels
- Limited/different I/O capabilities
- Unpredictable usage context
- Privacy & Security
- Sustainability

### Limited power supply

Increase battery size or use more efficiently.

Biggest energy consumers:
- Backlight
- GPS
- Wireless modules (WiFi, Bluetooth)
- Sensors (touchscreen, accelerometer)

Solutions:
- Disable when unused
- Lower polling frequency
- Maybe move some things to cloud?

### Limited storage

Bigger storage means a bigger phone.

Maybe fix by outsourcing to cloud, but then that is more energy consumption.

### Wireless

- Unpredictable throughput
- Bandwidth <-> energy consumption tradeoff
- media size outgrowing bandwidth
- Abrupt quality of service changes
- RTT may be too high
