# Exercise 06 - Case Studies

In the lecture, we have looked at the COVID-19 contact tracing protocol based on Bluetooth Low Energy.
For this exercise, consider why this system did not end up being widely used, even though it was ultimately
deployed on millions of smartphones. Write up two scenarios in which the app could give a false positive
(warning about a potential infection, even though you were never exposed) and two scenarios for false
negatives (not warning you despite potential exposure).
Based on what you learned previously about wireless communication and alternative input/output channels,
speculate about potential ways to mitigate these false positives and negatives.


People are not their phones!

# False positive cases

Imagine stowing you phone away in a gym locker.
You may or may not have contact with said person, but your phones could be in close proximity for a long time.

Another example might perhaps be waiting for a red light or when stuck in traffic. We are perfecly isolated but the BLE signal may be picked up by someone in the car next to you. Just navigating traffic would cause you to become suspect of COVID.

In the same genre, how thick are your walls? If you live in an apartment building this may happen as well. This can be generalized to any properly isolated instance however in close proximity.

# False negative cases

I go many places w/o my phone. I try to be more independant of it. Many times when buying groceries or just when I don't feel like it.

If an affected person has left home w/o their phone then there of course will be no tracking. Or if bluetooth was disabled.

Low adoption rates will also lead to false negatives.

There's of course also the risk of getting sick from contaminated surfaces,
then the exposure app would say nothing, but is that really a false negative?
If the goal is exposure to people and you get it from a surface
