### Discord/Messenger:
- Limited storage: 
1. Conversations are not "fully" loaded, it updates the conversation throughout scrolling. Requires a network connection to sync with cloud.

- Unpredictable usage context:
1. Easy context switches between mobile usage and desktop usage, app feels very recognizable on both platforms. 
2. When on the road or something else, wireless is not reliable so how does one know the message is received/sent? Both can be viewed in messenger, a message is marked sent and received and even read. 

- I/O Capabilities:
1. Video calls and incorporation of device features with the app.
2. Vision as input: also can make backgrounds besides recording the environment.
3. Vision as output: Video calls / conferences / group calls. 

- Privacy and Security
1. E2E encrypted.
2. Messenger has the option of protecting the ip-addresses for a call in exchange for lower quality audio. 

- Wireless communication
1. Calls and video sharing can have variable quality as to not try to send fx. an 1080p video over a connection that can't handle it. Then a lower quality stream would make for a better experience (stuttering and so on).
