# Discord

## Wireless communication channels

Discord can scale up & down the audio quality, and when for example streaming something, it can also scale the video quality. So in this scenario it prioritizes FPS rather than quality. That's sometimes an issue in terms of fx powerpoint slides in prep to exam.

## Unpredictable usage context

Sometimes people make Discord calls from the phone, sometimes from a homepc setup with proper mic and all that.

And sometimes from a bus, I am not sure whether there are any big changes, but it works well on both platforms.
Both in terms of usability, but they also tend to filter away background audio very well, so even when in an unpredictable environment the sound quality is fine.

## Limited storage

Keeps a cache of most recent messages from other users and will then poll from their servers if a user needs to look at their history, thereby minimizing the storage footprint.

## Limited/different I/O capabilities

When used on the phone the UI is different. Much better utilization of the small space given on the phone.
Leading to less fat finger problems.
On pc icons and stuff can be smaller, and instead they maximize information display.
On mobile the actions are also different, there is an intuitive swipe mechanic for navigation between different channels.
