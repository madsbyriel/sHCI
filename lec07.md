# Interactive Surfaces & Spaces (ISS)

- Surfaces
    - 2D position
    - 1D rotation

- Surface input types
    - (Multi-)Touch: 2D positions (+ rotation + hover)
    - pen/stylus: ID, 2D position, rotation, angle, pressure, hover
    - tokens: ID, 2D position, rotation
    - "blobs": 2D position, rotation, shape

- Spaces
    - 3D position
    - 3D rotation

- Spaces input types:
    - tracked objects: 6D pose
    - tracked controllers: 6D pose + buttons
    - handpose: 6D pose for all joints
    - full body pose

- Differentiation
    - is a tablet an interactive surface?
        - i would say yes? its a surface, and many people use the exact input types as described

    - is wearing an MR headset creating an interactive space?
        - i would say no, since it's not a real space, call it a virtual interactive space
        - without the virtual qualifier, then I would assume a real space in which we interact

- big issues are similar to mobile devices
    - touch related issues
    - gestures and discoverability
- unique to iss
    - fatigue (waving hands around all the time, striking poses)
    - infrastructure requirements

- examples:
    - tangible interaction (ISS):
        - reactable (table with some tokens, and make connections to make sound)
            - a music instrument as well

        - sandscape, elevate certain areas of a surface to make it 3D, good for visualising landscape
            - also good for weather, hydrodynamics, architecture
            - real sand

    - mixed reality (virtual ISS):
        - virtual valcamonica, some history museeum where some parts are interactive
            - visualize prehistoric rock carvings
            - multiple display and collaboration features (using shutter glass)
            - large scale tracking environment

        - anatomy education (virtual space teaching anatomy)
            - requires shared space
            - better alone or in groups?
    
    - interactive ads
        - shows overlay of people's silhouettes on the screen
        - not that interactive?

    - SPLOM Wall
        - ScatterPLOt Matrix
        - visualization of large datasets
        - 4.1 x 2.3 m wall display
        - how to reach everything?
