# Exercise 07 - Interactive Surfaces and Spaces

Consider the following usage scenarios:
- ship navigation, e.g. on the bridge of a large container vessel
- emergency response and coordination after a large-scale disaster
- a casual but fast-paced game for four players, such as airhockey
- collaborative text writing for a research paper
- air traffic control in an international airport

For each of these scenarios, which of the following interface types would be most appropriate?
- a regular laptop or desktop computer
- a mobile phone or tablet device
- a large interactive surface
- a mixed-reality space

Write a short paragraph for each scenario in which you explain your reasoning

## ship navigation, e.g. on the bridge of a large container vessel

very mush ISS, use a surface like sandscape.
Wait, are we talking navigation ON-SHIP or with ship? Either way I think sandscape could be good.

or use a more simple surface, could be as simple as a satellite image overlaid with trajectories
works best if it is parellel to plane on which we move (laid down horizontally)

## emergency response and coordination after a large-scale disaster

simply has to be mobile or a mix. Briefing could use an interactive space, simple surface with sat image could do
highlighting areas with injured. once briefing is over, each rescuer would need access quick access to resources
and therefore it has to be mobile based.
The mobile part is mainly focused on reporting and info sharing, and considering the fast-paced nature, maybe
a voice-assisted app could be great, however it has to be precise.

## a casual but fast-paced game for four players, such as airhockey

I doubt a mixed reality solution could sync game state between four players and render in time to not have significant lag-spikes ruining gameplay. Steps to do -> head tracking -> cam capture -> 3D scene construction -> (video mixing or projection overlay). Its too much

Again, am I biased???? I think a surface would do just fine. overhead projector, down unto the game surface, virtual hockey thing, tracking of hand movements or other artifact for control. Could maybe have issues with occlusion, but I think it should be fine?
Otherwise move away from the overhead projector and only use overhead tracker and have a very rough display surface. Either way.

## collaborative text writing for a research paper

i think anything other than a laptop or desktop and you're gonna have trouble with how fast paced writing really is.
who would be satisfied with janky non-tactile keyboard input? Not me!
Just to be creative, it would be a relatively simple 3D scene, you could use a virtual keyboard, or just use a keyboard as-is, and have document in 3D but there is no real gain to this besides fun.

If everyone are sat in the same room, then a large surface (maybe wall projection) could work as a way of real-time feedback during writing, but still, input would still be keyboard and usefulness doesn't outcompete something like Typst.


## air traffic control in an international airport

this could be a great use-case for a mixed-reality solution! Flight data and flight corridors are inherintly 3D so it makes sense to use a 3D environment, maybe a virtual one.
Use a mixed-reality collaborative space, for visualization and planning of flight corridors (I don't know what they do for work, do they plan these?). 3D scene doesn't have hard real-time requirements, as state shouldn't change drastically from moment to moment.
